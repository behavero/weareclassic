# 🔧 Diagonal Dividers Removed

**Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Issue

White triangle effects appearing between sections:
- Between Hero and Mission sections
- Between Mission and Concerts sections

These diagonal dividers created visual noise that didn't fit the minimalist design.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Why Remove the Dividers?**

The diagonal dividers were added to "break the rectangular form" and add visual interest. However, they:
- Created unwanted white triangles
- Added visual clutter
- Didn't fit the minimalist, elegant style
- Competed with content for attention

**Clean transitions** better serve the:
- High-end classical music aesthetic
- Professional presentation
- Content-first approach
- Minimalist design language

## 💡 Note

The `DiagonalDivider` component still exists in:
`/Users/martin/We_Are_Classic/src/components/ui/DiagonalDivider.tsx`

If you want to fully clean up, you can delete this file. However, it's harmless to keep it since it's no longer being imported or used anywhere.
