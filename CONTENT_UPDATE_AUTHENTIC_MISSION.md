❌ Failed to highlight core services: **cinematic recordings** and **professional promotion**  
❌ Didn't emphasize support for **young talents** alongside established artists  
❌ Missed positioning the **"We Are Classics Series" as flagship project**  
❌ Didn't communicate the **innovation** and **fresh breath** you bring to Romanian arts
